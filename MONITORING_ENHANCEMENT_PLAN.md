# Monitoring System Enhancement Plan

## Current Infrastructure Analysis

### Existing Components
✅ **Performance Monitoring Middleware** - Basic request tracking, response times, memory usage
✅ **Health Checks** - Database and external service health monitoring
✅ **System Analytics Service** - Comprehensive business metrics and system statistics
✅ **Exception Handling Middleware** - Structured error handling and logging
✅ **Rate Limiting** - Request throttling and abuse prevention
✅ **Serilog Integration** - Structured logging with file output

  - Error tracking in React components
  - User journey analytics
  - Real-time performance monitoring

- **Business Metrics Integration**
  - Daily active users tracking
  - Feature utilization metrics
  - Notification delivery effectiveness
  - Photo consent workflow metrics

## 2. Error Monitoring System Enhancement
- **Structured Error Categorization**
  - Error classification by severity and type

  - Error trend analysis and alerting
  - Root cause analysis support

- **Error Rate Monitoring**
  - Real-time error rate tracking per endpoint
  - Error threshold monitoring with automated alerts
  - Error recovery tracking and success rates

## 3. Real-time Monitoring Dashboard
- **Live Metrics Endpoints**
